## Description

Wordle is 2022's first internet trend and for good reason. It's an online game that gives players only 6 guesses at a random 5 letter word, available once a day. I like the simplicity of the game and how fun it is, I also enjoy the natural competitive nature of the game since every player in the world has the same word. Initially developed for the creator's partner, the game has risen to millions of users in a short timeframe and yet it still lacks a paywall, ads, and any sort of stigma. The game is only playable once a day, doesn't have a share feature, and explicitly doesn't compete for user's time nor attention.

I have viewed the article and it seems to be a game of intellect and strategy, which I find fun. Because there seems to be not paywall to enjoy this competitive game I will definitely check it out when I have the time.

I tried this game using that webpage and feel like it iis a good game. It involving using word to compete with another player. I think people who like to play this kind of games would always be smart and intelligent.
